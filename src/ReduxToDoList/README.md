# ReduxToDoList Directory

This folder demonstrates state management using Redux in a React application:

- **Redux Store:** `store.js` sets up a Redux store with actions, action creators, and a reducer for managing a todo list.
- **React-Redux Integration:** Components use `useSelector` to access state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.
- **Todo List Functionality:** `todoList.js` allows adding todos, and `displayTodo.js` displays and removes todos from the Redux store.

This directory is a reference for integrating Redux with React, managing global state, and structuring Redux logic in a modular way.
