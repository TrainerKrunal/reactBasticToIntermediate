# PerformanceOptimization Directory

This folder demonstrates advanced React concepts for optimizing component performance:

- **useMemo:** `useMemoDemo.js` shows how to memoize expensive calculations to avoid unnecessary recomputation on re-renders.
- **React.memo:** `reactMemoDemo.js` and `childComponent.js` illustrate how to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components by memoizing them.
- **useCallback:** Used in `reactMemoDemo.js` to memoize callback functions passed to child components, further reducing re-renders.

These techniques are essential for building efficient React applications, especially when dealing with complex or resource-intensive UI updates.
