# Hooks Directory

This folder demonstrates the use of React Hooks for state and side-effect management, as well as custom hooks:

- **useState:** Shown in `useStateDemo.js` for managing local state variables like counters and text fields.
- **useEffect:** Used in `useEffectDemo.js` to handle side effects such as logging and responding to state changes.
- **Custom Hooks:** `useFetchDemo.js` is a custom hook for fetching data from an API, encapsulating loading, error, and data state.
- **Component Usage of Hooks:** `fetchDemoComp.js` shows how to use a custom hook within a component to fetch and display data.

This directory is a reference for best practices in using built-in and custom hooks to manage state and side effects in React functional components.
