# Pages Directory

This folder contains components that represent different pages or sections of the application. It demonstrates:

- **Page Components:** Each file (e.g., `homePage.js`, `aboutPage.js`, `customerPage.js`) represents a distinct page or view.
- **Navigation:** Components are used as route targets in React Router, enabling navigation between pages.
- **Reusable UI Elements:** Includes shared UI elements like `appNavBar.js` (navigation bar) and `seperator.js` (visual separator).

This directory illustrates how to organize and structure page-level components in a React application, supporting navigation and modular UI design.
