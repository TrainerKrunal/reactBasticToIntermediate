# Users Directory

This folder contains components for displaying and managing user data fetched from an external API. It demonstrates:

- **Fetching Data with Axios:** Components use Axios to fetch user data from a remote API.
- **React Router Integration:** `userList.js` uses `useNavigate` to programmatically navigate to user details pages, and `userDetails.js` uses `useParams` to read route parameters.
- **State and Effect Hooks:** Both components use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage data and side effects.
- **Dynamic Routing:** The application supports dynamic routes for user details based on user ID.

This directory is a practical example of integrating API data, routing, and state management in React.
